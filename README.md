# Building a Weather Layer

We are building a layer that displays weather data in top of the page content.

For the data we will be using the [OpenWeatherMap API][1], the weather layer
will display in a corner of the viewport and will switch corners at a regular
interval.

## Design decisions

We could have started with something like the [HTML5 Boilerplate][2], or used a
library like Angular or React, but the task is simple enough that using plain
HTML/JS/CSS and starting from scratch is also a good option.


## Viewing the result

The page is accessible in GitHub Pages.
